# Developing a Client for the Virtual Library System

## Project Overview

The objective of this component is to develop a client application in Go that interacts with the Virtual Library System's RESTful API server. This client will provide users with the capability to perform operations such as adding, retrieving, updating, and deleting book records through a command-line interface (CLI). The client will demonstrate effective API consumption practices in Go and offer an intuitive user experience.

## Tools and Libraries

- **Go:** The programming language used to develop the client application, chosen for its simplicity and efficiency in building command-line and networked applications.
- **Swagger (Client Code Generation):** If the server's API is documented with Swagger, the Swagger Codegen tool can be used to automatically generate client libraries in Go, streamlining the development process.

## Client Functionality

The client application will support the following functionalities, aligning with the server's capabilities:

1. **Add a New Book**
   - Facilitates adding a new book record to the library through the API.
2. **List All Books**
   - Retrieves and displays a list of all books available in the library.
3. **Get Book Details**
   - Fetches detailed information about a specific book by its ID.
4. **Update Book Information**
   - Allows the modification of an existing book's details.
5. **Delete a Book**
   - Removes a book record from the library.
